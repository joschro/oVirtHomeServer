Passwords are stored in inventory/group_vars/all/vault.yml; please edit this file (or for your convenience, password.yml in this directoy) to reflect the passwords you would like to apply to your system and encrypt the file afterwards with

$ ansible-vault encrypt inventory/group_vars/all/vault.yml

The Ansible playbooks will then ask you every time they are run for the password you used to encrypt the vault.yml file.
